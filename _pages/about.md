Xiang Hu is a research scientist from Ant Research. He graduated with a master's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where he studied programming languages under the supervision of [Jianjun Zhao](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=PZZ0iygAAAAJ&hl=ja). During his career at Ant Group, he developed an interest in natural language processing, started self-studying, and began publishing academic papers. His main interest lies in exploring the inductive biases that facilitate human-like language comprehension, including hierarchical language structures, long-term randomly accessible semantic memory, and the relationship between language and symbols. Currently, his research is primarily conducted along two lines. One line focuses on human-like hierarchical language comprehension by mapping utterance-level representations to ontological concepts, and then linking these concepts to basic neural predicates. Another newly initiated line of research involves ultra-long range language modeling to explore human-like long-term randomly accessible semantic memory. He built a library for building self-supervised hierarchical text representation at [ant-research/StructuredLM_RTDT](https://github.com/ant-research/StructuredLM_RTDT).
